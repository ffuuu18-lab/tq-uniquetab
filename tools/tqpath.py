"""Find the Titan Quest Anniversary Edition installation without writing a path down.

Every tool in this folder that reads the game's own files goes through game_dir(). The order is:

    1. %TQ_GAME_DIR%                  the explicit answer; always wins
    2. the Steam client's own registry key, plus every library folder Steam lists
    3. give up with a message that says what to set

Nothing here contains a drive letter or a user folder: the game is found, never written down.
(GD's tools/gdpath.py with the TQ folder, marker and variable - the same rule tools/test_bindings.cpp
and deploy.bat follow.)
