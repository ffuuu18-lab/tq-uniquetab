// ut_textfold.h - one case-folding rule for both sides of the tier-C name match.
//
// The engine hands `ReagentWindow::UpdateSearch` a needle it has
// already trimmed and LOWERCASED, as UTF-16; `catalogue.bin` holds display names
// as UTF-8. Rather than guess that both are plain ASCII, both are decoded to code points,
// lowercased by the SAME rule and re-encoded as UTF-8 - so the match itself is a plain `strstr`
// over two strings produced identically. No locale, no Windows call, no allocation at match time.
//
// Only ASCII is lowercased, and accents are neither folded nor stripped. That is deliberate, and
// it is what makes the "under-reports and never over-reports" promise PROVABLE rather than
// hoped-for - see `utFoldCp`.
//
// Pure: no Windows, no engine, no globals. `ut_plate.cpp` uses it and `tools\test_rowfold.cpp`
// links this very header.

// Simple (1:1) lowercase over ASCII, and ASCII ONLY. Every other code point comes back unchanged.
//
// Lowercasing Latin-1 (0xC0..0xDE) and Latin Extended-A as well cannot be proved equivalent to
// the engine's own `ctype<wchar_t>::tolower` (exe 0x136200, applied to BOTH the needle and the
// item's rollover text). If the game's locale leaves a capital A-umlaut alone, a needle
// "a-umlaut" fails the ENGINE's match while passing a mod fold that folded it: an OVER-report,
// the one direction that must never happen.
//
// Restricted to ASCII the promise is provable. The engine's fold is this fold composed with a
// per-code-point map that leaves ASCII alone; applying the same length-preserving 1:1 map to both
// sides of a substring relation can only ever REMOVE matches, never add one. So "the mod matched"
// implies "the engine would have matched the same name": the promise, never an over-report.
//
// Nothing is lost on the shipped data: `catalogue.bin` carries no accented display name at all
// (measured - zero multi-byte UTF-8 sequences anywhere inside a name), so the Latin-1 rules could
// never have fired on the name side to begin with.
